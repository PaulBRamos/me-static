# Gameified Resume

WIP: A mario-clone-like game that was originally intended to act as a resume or demonstration of skills.

* The game engine components are all written from scratch.
* Animation is done using CSS Animation
* ReactJS was used for the Mario Sprite to update his animation and other values
* Bower is used for asset management
* Brunch is used for building
* ES6 is used throughout

NOTE: The goal was to hire an arist to create original assets for this project (which I'm still doing), so I'm currently using Mario-like assets I found online as place holders. I do not claim any rights to those assets and are likely (C) Nintendo
